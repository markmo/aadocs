1. Create a new Squad by clicking on the "Create" Button in the top Nav Bar.

1. Fill in the form as you please, e.g.

   - Name: My Squad
   - Description: A test squad.

   You will be added to the list of members by default.

   Click "Submit" to create the Squad. You will be returned to the list page.

1. Click on the "Select" Action next to the new Squad. You'll see that the
   Squad appears in the top-right corner of the Nav Bar. This is the currently
   selected Squad when working in other parts of the application. All work is
   done in context of a particular Squad. A User may belong to more than one Squad.
   You may also notice that additional functions in the Side Menu only appear when
   a Squad is selected.

1. The "Campaigns" Action takes you to the list of Campaigns. This is the same as
   clicking Campaigns in the Side Menu except this action will automatically change
   the selected Squad.

**Create a New Campaign**

1. Click the "Campaigns" Action. The list will be empty. Create a new Campaign by
   clicking on the "Create" Button in the top Nav Bar. You will be taken to a form
   to enter the Campaign details. This will include details used by the Content
   Generator to customise the content.

   additional details for the Campaign. These details define features that are used
   in Prompts to customise the content generation.

1. Click the "Set" button, which opens a form to define the primary features of the
   Campaign. Fill in the form as you wish, e.g.

   - Format: Email Subject Line

**Generate Content**

1. Click on the "Creative" Action next to the new Campaign. This opens the main
   Creative Workbench. To create more space, you can compact the Side Menu by
   clicking on the left arrow at the bottom of the Side Menu.

   On the left of the work area is a summary of the Campaign features.

   On the right are parameters to control the generation process.

   The middle area includes, from top to bottom:

   <ol type="A">
     <li>Search box to find previously generated content, or content generated by other users.
     <li>A list of content already generated for this Campaign. Content is divided into two
         tabs &ndash; Copy and Images.
     <li>Functions to "Auto Generate" content given the Campaign Features and Generation Parameters,
         or alternatively, a Chat interface to interact directly with ChatGPT to generate
         content.
   </ol>

1. One of the Generation Parameters is to create variants based on a category such as "Need State".
   Click "Set" in the "Variation" > "By Category" field. This will open a window to define the
   variation parameters.

1. Select "Need State" from the "Vary by" dropdown. This will show a list of Need States.

   Check "Gaming" and "Working from Anywhere" in the left-hand box. Click the right-arrow in
   the middle to transfer these items to the "Selected" box on the right.

   Click "Set" to add these variations to the Generation Parameters.

   ![Empty ](/assets/selected-variations.png)

1. Click "Autogen", which is located just below the Copy list. This uses the Campaign Features and
   Generation Parameters to generate copy content. The content will appear at the top of the
   Copy List.

   ![Empty ](/assets/generated-copy.png)

1. Click the "Edit" Action to make a change. Change as you will. To save the copy, select the
   row, then click "Save", which is located just above the list.

**Submit for Review**

1. We'll promote this copy for internal review. Click on the "Submit for Review" Action and, for
   the purpose of this tutorial, add yourself as the reviewer from the dropdown.

1. Click on "My Reviews" in the Side Menu. You will see a list of content, assigned to you, to
   approve. Click "Approve" for the item you just assigned.

This concludes the Tutorial. We've only covered a subset of the capabilities, but hopefully it's
provided a flavour of what the application is capable of. Stay tuned for further documentation
and examples.
