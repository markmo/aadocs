A Prompt is an instruction or example provided to ChatGPT to facilitate the expected 
response for an input.

The process of "prompt engineering" is different from other NLP services which are
designed for a single task, such as sentiment classification or named entity recognition.
Instead, the ChatGPT model can be used for a range of tasks including content or code 
generation, summarization, expansion, conversation, creative writing, style transfer, and more.

A popular structure for prompts starts with telling ChatGPT what role it should play. Then
the prompt states what information will be provided, followed by what should be done with
it, being as explicit as possible. Providing examples and expected output helps.

There is no prescribed formula and techniques differ. It's important to remember that ChatGPT
is a next word prediction machine. As much context as can be provided helps ChatGPT construct a
"story" that extends or completes the user's input, wrapped with whatever prompts the application
adds.
