**Welcome to AgencyAI**

AgencyAI is a tool to help generate copywriting and graphic ideas for creative teams, and manage the creative workflow.

AgencyAI is in an alpha testing stage to experiment with new features, collect feedback and requirements, and to stabilise
the application.

Work is organised into Squads and Campaigns. A Squad has members working on one or more Campaigns. A Campaign has a creative
brief, and is the repository of generated content.

To get started, a Squad must be created and/or selected to enable the creative functions.
